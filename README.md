# GeolocationClustering
A simple project with python codes for implementation of four different approaches for geolocation clustering for optimum Radio Resource Management.
The work done here aims to develop a robust clustering algorithm which can pave the way for allocation of aerial base stations to areas with heavy demand. Numerous approaches have been tried here such as K Means Clustering, DBSCAN, HDBSCAN, and a novel hybrid approach for addressal of the issue of outliers leading to the development of a pipeline suitable for use in a real-world situation.
